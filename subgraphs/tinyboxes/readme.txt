You're on the right track with checking those files! Here's a breakdown of the key files to examine and what to look for to understand why your subgraph might not have current data:

1. subgraph.yaml

    dataSources: This section defines the smart contracts your subgraph is indexing.
        source.address: Make sure the contract address is correct.
        source.startBlock: This is crucial! It tells you the block number where indexing began. If this is too recent, your subgraph won't have older data.
        mapping.eventHandlers: This lists the events your subgraph is listening for (e.g., Transfer, Mint). Verify that the events you need are included.
    schema.graphql: This defines the entities and their properties that your subgraph stores. Ensure it aligns with the data you want to query.

2. src/tiny-boxes.ts (Your Mapping Code)

    Event Handlers: This file contains the logic that processes events from your smart contracts.
        Examine the code within each event handler: Is it correctly extracting and storing the data you expect?
        Look for any filtering logic: Are there conditions that might be unintentionally excluding recent data?
        Check for errors or incomplete logic: Make sure the code handles all relevant cases and doesn't have bugs that prevent data from being stored.

3. abis/TinyBoxes.json

    ABI Accuracy: This file contains the ABI (Application Binary Interface) for your smart contract. An incorrect or outdated ABI can prevent the subgraph from properly decoding events and parameters.

Debugging Steps

    Recent Events: Start by confirming that your subgraph is indexing recent events. You can do this by:
        Looking at the latest blocks processed in your subgraph's dashboard on The Graph's hosted service.
        Triggering a transaction in your smart contract and seeing if the subgraph picks it up.
    Logs and Errors: Check the subgraph logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate problems with indexing.
    Redeploy with an Earlier startBlock: If you determine that the startBlock is the issue, you'll need to redeploy your subgraph with an earlier block number to include the missing data.

If you can share the contents of your subgraph.yaml and relevant parts of your mapping code (tiny-boxes.ts), I might be able to provide more specific guidance!
